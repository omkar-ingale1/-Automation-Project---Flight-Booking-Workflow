# MakeMyTrip Flight Booking Workflow Automation with Selenium WebDriver

## Description:

The "MakeMyTrip Flight Booking Workflow" project harnesses the power of Selenium WebDriver to automate the end-to-end process of booking flights on the MakeMyTrip travel portal. This project utilizes a variety of web elements such as **dropdowns, auto-suggestive dropdowns, date pickers, radio buttons, and passenger selection controls** to replicate the user journey through the flight booking process.

- ## Key Features:

- **Dropdown Selection**: The project incorporates Selenium WebDriver's capabilities to interact with dropdown menus, enabling the selection of various parameters such as departure city, destination city, preferred airline, and flight class.

- **Auto-Suggestive Dropdowns**: Leveraging WebDriver's functionality, the project implements automated interaction with auto-suggestive dropdowns for entering departure and destination cities, providing users with convenient options based on input.

- **Date Picker Handling**: Selenium WebDriver facilitates the automation of date selection using date pickers. The project employs WebDriver to navigate through calendars, choose departure and return dates, and handle date validations.

- **Radio Button Selection**: Through WebDriver's API, the project interacts with radio buttons to specify preferences such as one-way or round-trip flights, cabin class preferences, and additional services like meal preferences or seat selection.

- **Passenger Selection**: Selenium WebDriver enables the automation of passenger selection, including adults, children, and infants. The project utilizes loops and conditional statements (if-else) to dynamically handle variations in passenger counts and age groups.

- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Following the Page Object Model design pattern, the project organizes web elements and their interactions into separate page classes. This abstraction enhances maintainability, readability, and reusability of test code, enabling efficient test creation and maintenance.
